            Welcome to the Political Career Tracker (PCT)!
            <p> We have updated PCT with all contesting candidates and their information for the 2022 state assembly elections of Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. This does not include the results-related data yet - this will be updated as and when the results are released.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
            Indian politicians tend to have short careers. Often, in a given assembly, more than half of the sitting MPs or MLAs do not serve a consecutive term. As a result, most elected representatives tend to be first-time MPs or MLAs.
            </p>
            <p>
            The PCT, designed by TCPD, is a visualisation tool that measures this phenomenon and other aspects of Indian politicians' careers. Its interface helps you visualize all candidates contesting a particular election and enables you to filter these candidates by various categories: first-time contestants, re-running incumbents, turncoats, among others. The data interface also provides information on the number of terms served by MPs and MLAs, and the number of times that the candidates have contested.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every individual who contested a state or national election since 1962 has been given a unique identification number (PID), thanks to TCPD's tool <a href="https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/surf" target="_blank" class="pubtna">Surf</a>, a name matching software that identifies and groups possible identical entities in a list of names, regardless of spelling variations. <a class="pubtna" target="_blank" href="mailto:tcpd-contact@ashoka.edu.in">Contact us</a> if you are interested in using Surf for other datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
            The data used in PCT is freely accessible. We encourage you to look at the raw data and use it for your research or work. If you have any query or notice an error, please  <a class="pubtna" target="_blank" href="mailto:tcpd-contact@ashoka.edu.in">write to us</a>. We value your <a class="pubtna" target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/SGfhSYfaf15GPiUo6">feedback</a> and recommend that you <a class="pubtna" target="_blank" href="data/2022Jan31PCTCodebook_2_1.pdf">read the documentation</a> before using the tool.
